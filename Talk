Introduction to React Native

- Let's set some expectations:
*** I do not have any affilation with React Native whatsoever
*** I do not have any production applications running in React Native
*** Just like to explore, have toyed with Ionic and was unhappy about it

- What is React Native?
*** Frame work to build Native Apps by Facebook
*** Uses JavaScript and CSS, but not HTML -> JSX
*** Compiles the React code into native UI components -> Better UI

- Difference with Ionic Framework
*** Webview vs Native components

- React
*** You just code in React, just like we do for the Web
*** Instead of HTML elements, we use React Native components
*** Use standard CSS, which is translated into styling for UI components
*** Uses flexbox for layoyt
*** ES&!

- Why React Native?
*** Relatively easy to get started: No need to learn Swift/Objective-C
*** Uses all of the cool technologies that we are used to
*** Has gotten more popular in the last year: 39k+ stars on github, job prospects

- Why not React Native? (In my experience)
*** Getting started for iOS was relatively easy, but Android was a whole other story
*** Final build has caused me quite some headaches
*** Debugging deployment issues seems to require some knowledge of the actial platform... considering everything is antive this makes sense... maybe some prior knowledge might have been useful

- Easiest way to get started?
*** DEMO: React Native Playground

- CLI get started
*** Demo: containerLogoImage
*** Demo: Refresh, debug

- Demo: Github Explorer
*** React, redux
*** Fetch polyfill
*** Text, TextInput, Image, TouchableHighlight, ActivityIndicator, AsyncStorage
